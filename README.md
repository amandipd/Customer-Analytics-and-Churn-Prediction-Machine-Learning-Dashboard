# Customer Insights ML Tool

## Overview

This project simulates the creation of an internal tool for companies to gain actionable insights about their customers. The tool is designed to help businesses:

- Predict how much a customer might spend
- Segment customers into meaningful groups for targeted marketing
- Identify customers who are at risk of leaving (churn risk)

*Note: The data used in this project was synthetically generated and is based on the Kaggle dataset: [E-Commerce Customer Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/e-commerce-customer-behavior-dataset).*

By using this tool, companies can make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention, personalize marketing, and maximize revenue.

## Main Capabilities

### Model Prediction (Customer Spend Prediction)
This feature predicts how much a customer is likely to spend in the future based on their profile and behavior (such as age, city, membership type, purchase history, etc.). It helps businesses forecast revenue, identify high-value customers, and tailor offers to those most likely to spend more. You enter customer details into a form, and the tool uses machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to estimate their expected spend.

### Customer Segmentation
This feature groups customers into segments (clusters) based on similarities in their data (like age, spending, satisfaction, etc.). Segmentation allows companies to understand different types of customers and create targeted marketing campaigns for each group (e.g., special offers for new customers, loyalty rewards for frequent buyers). You select which features to use, and the tool applies clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN) to organize customers into distinct groups. The results show the characteristics of each segment.

### Churn Risk Classification
This feature predicts whether a customer is at risk of leaving (churning) and provides a probability score for that risk. By identifying customers likely to leave, businesses can take proactive steps (like special offers or outreach) to retain them. You enter customer information, and the tool uses a machine learning model (Random Forest) to estimate the likelihood that the customer will churn, along with a clear probability score.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- **Linear Regression:** Predicts customer spend based on input features.
- **Random Forest:** Used for both spend prediction and churn risk classification; combines many decision trees for robust results.
- **XGBoost Regression:** Advanced regression model for spend prediction.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups customers into segments based on feature similarity.
- **DBSCAN Clustering:** Finds clusters of customers with similar behaviors, even if the clusters are irregularly shaped.

## Example Use Cases

- Revenue Forecasting: Predict how much a new or existing customer will spend.
- Targeted Marketing: Segment customers and design campaigns for each group.
- Customer Retention: Identify and reach out to customers at high risk of churning.

## Why This Project?

This tool was created as a simulation of an internal company dashboard for customer analytics. The goal was to provide a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to leverage machine learning for actionable business insightsâ€”without needing a background in data science.
